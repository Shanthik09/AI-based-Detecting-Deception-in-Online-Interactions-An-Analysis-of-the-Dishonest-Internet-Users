This seems unbalanced.  whatever I have said about Mathsci, he has said far more extreme and unpleasant things about me (not to mention others), and with much greater frequency.  I'm more than happy to reign myself in, if that's what you'd like (ruth be told, I was just trying to get Mathsci to pay attention and stop being uncivil).  I would expect you to issue the same request to Mathsci.  

 If this is intentionally unbalanced (for whatever reason), please let me know, and I will voluntarily close this account and move on to other things.  I like wikipedia, and I have a lot to contribute in my own way, but there is no point contributing to the project if some editors have administrative leave to be aggressively rude.  I'm a good editor, and I don't really deserve to have people riding my ass every time I try to do certain things.  I'll happily leave it in the hands of the drama-prone, if that's what you think is best.  Ludwigs2 """

"New Categories 

I honestly think that we need to add some more categories and move some characters into these new categories. Like, characters such as Pete Ross or Whitney Fordman who haven't been on the show in a while, and are listed as main characters? That just doesn't make sense. Perhaps creating a deceased/former characters section? I'll start doing it now. If anyone has a problem, please post it in this discussion."

"YES/ Poland and Lithuania define marriage as a union between a man and a woman in thay constitutions just as several other countries in Europe e.g. Spain, France etc. They are not mentioned here. Why? 
And Latvia not only define marriage as a union between a man and a woman in its civil law and constitution (since 2006) but also bans same sex marriages in those acts. So it is the only country in Europe to do so. (first to BANN same sex marriage, and NOT third to define marriage...)

Hello

I feel that my addition of external links to the Wikipedia pages """"Genesis creation narrative,"""" """"Ibbur,"""" and """"Gilgul"""" have been unfairly flagged for inappropriate activity. The external links added are primary source texts directly related to the Wikipedia page subject . They are not commercial or ideological. Please advise.

Thank you 
Jeangohile

I removed them because they linked to a blog and blogs are not considered reliable sources for Wikipedia, if you feel they are a special case you could discuss on the article talk pages. This link may be helpful links normally to be avoided All good wishes   

Ok I understand and thanks for responding. I still feel my external links provide important primary source texts that are not available online. Yes they are presented on a blog but there is no writing of my own presented. Please reconsider.

"I've also looked at Shervink's sources and I find them all to be either biased, inaplicable, or unreliable. In my opinion Shervink is advocating a minority viewpoint. Perhaps he should express within the article and note it as such, but clearly it is not reasonable to expect this view to be represented equally with generally accepted facts. 
I feel that this is mostly a well written and informative article and that this whole coup or counter coup thing is pointless. These events are accepted by most sources to have been a coup. What this means is that Mossadeq is accepted to have been the leader of Iran at the time in question, and to have been deposed. The phrase counter-coup implies that Mossadeq deposed the Shah first, which according to the ample scholarship cited in this article, is not what happened. 
It is of course possible that the concensus of scholarship on this issue is in error, but those who beleive this to be the case are by definition, holders of minority viewpoints. 
That said, I do think Shervink's views are interesting and should be included (and noted as a minority viewpoint) in the article. This issue is generally seen as the west vs. Iran with the shah on the side of the west. A point of view more sympathetic to the monarchy is rarely heard.  Itsafarce"
